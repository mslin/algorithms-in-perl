**Abstract:** The problem of counting maximal independent sets is #P-complete for chordal graphs but solvable in polynomial time for its subclass of interval graphs. This work improves upon both of these results by showing that the problem remains #P-complete when restricted to directed path graphs but that a further restriction to rooted directed path graphs admits a polynomial time solution.
