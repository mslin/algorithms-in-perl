**Abstract:**  A connected graph is distance-hereditary if any two vertices have the same distance in all of its connected induced subgraphs. This paper proposes a unified method for designing linear-time algorithms for counting independent sets and their two variants, independent dominating sets and independent perfect dominating sets, in distance-hereditary graphs.
