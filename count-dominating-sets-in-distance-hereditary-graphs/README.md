**Abstract:** Counting dominating sets (DSs) in a graph is a #P-complete problem even for chordal bipartite graphs and split graphs, which are both subclasses of weakly chordal graphs. This paper investigates this problem for distance-hereditary graphs, which is another known subclass of weakly chordal graphs. This work develops linear-time algorithms for counting DSs and their two variants, total DSs and connected DSs in distance-hereditary graphs.
